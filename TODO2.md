# To complete this branch we need to:
- find a way not to duplicate variable files
- find a way to avoid needing '-i /mnt'
- make sure play is idempotent (unmount and decrypt even if fail)
- fish: 'Configure abbreviations' gets nothing as value
- gpg keys still get created in /root/.gnupg ... (this is crazy)
