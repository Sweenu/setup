#: Clipboard {{{

# map kitty_mod+c  copy_to_clipboard
# map kitty_mod+v  paste_from_clipboard
# map kitty_mod+s  paste_from_selection
# map shift+insert paste_from_selection
# map kitty_mod+o  pass_selection_to_program

#: You can also pass the contents of the current selection to any
#: program using pass_selection_to_program. By default, the system's
#: open program is used, but you can specify your own, for example::

#:     map kitty_mod+o pass_selection_to_program firefox

#: You can pass the current selection to a terminal program running in
#: a new kitty window, by using the @selection placeholder::

#:     map kitty_mod+y new_window less @selection

#: Scrolling {{{

# map kitty_mod+up        scroll_line_up
# map kitty_mod+k         scroll_line_up
# map kitty_mod+down      scroll_line_down
# map kitty_mod+j         scroll_line_down
# map kitty_mod+page_up   scroll_page_up
# map kitty_mod+page_down scroll_page_down
# map kitty_mod+home      scroll_home
# map kitty_mod+end       scroll_end
# map kitty_mod+h         show_scrollback

#: You can pipe the contents of the current screen + history buffer as
#: STDIN to an arbitrary program using the ``pipe`` function. For
#: example, the following opens the scrollback buffer in less in an
#: overlay window::

#:     map f1 pipe @ansi overlay less +G -R

#: Placeholders available are: @text (which is plain text) and @ansi
#: (which includes text styling escape codes). For only the current
#: screen, use @screen or @ansi_screen. For the secondary screen, use
#: @alternate and @ansi_alternate. The secondary screen is the screen
#: not currently displayed. For example if you run a fullscreen
#: terminal application, the secondary screen will be the screen you
#: return to when quitting the application. You can also use ``none``
#: for no STDIN input.

#: To open in a new window, tab or new OS window, use ``window``,
#: ``tab``, or ``os_window`` respectively. You can also use ``none``
#: in which case the data will be piped into the program without
#: creating any windows, useful if the program is a GUI program that
#: creates its own windows.

#: Font sizes {{{

#: You can change the font size for all top-level kitty windows at a
#: time or only the current one.

map kitty_mod+equal     change_font_size all +2.0
map kitty_mod+minus     change_font_size all -2.0
map kitty_mod+backspace change_font_size all 0

#: Select and act on visible text {{{

#: Use the hints kitten to select text and either pass it to an
#: external program or insert it into the terminal or copy it to the
#: clipboard.

# map kitty_mod+e kitten hints

#: Open a currently visible URL using the keyboard. The program used
#: to open the URL is specified in open_url_with.

# map kitty_mod+p>f kitten hints --type path --program -

#: Select a path/filename and insert it into the terminal. Useful, for
#: instance to run git commands on a filename output from a previous
#: git command.

# map kitty_mod+p>shift+f kitten hints --type path

#: Select a path/filename and open it with the default open program.

# map kitty_mod+p>l kitten hints --type line --program -

#: Select a line of text and insert it into the terminal. Use for the
#: output of things like: ls -1

# map kitty_mod+p>w kitten hints --type word --program -

#: Select words and insert into terminal.

# map kitty_mod+p>h kitten hints --type hash --program -

#: Select something that looks like a hash and insert it into the
#: terminal. Useful with git, which uses sha1 hashes to identify
#: commits


#: The hints kitten has many more modes of operation that you can map
#: to different shortcuts. For a full description see kittens/hints.

#: Miscellaneous {{{

# map kitty_mod+u      kitten unicode_input
# map kitty_mod+f2     edit_config_file
# map kitty_mod+escape kitty_shell window

#: Open the kitty shell in a new window/tab/overlay/os_window to
#: control kitty using commands.

# map kitty_mod+delete clear_terminal reset active

#: You can create shortcuts to clear/reset the terminal. For example::

#:     map kitty_mod+f9 clear_terminal reset active
#:     map kitty_mod+f10 clear_terminal clear active
#:     map kitty_mod+f11 clear_terminal scrollback active

#: These will reset screen/clear screen/clear screen+scrollback
#: respectively. If you want to operate on all windows instead of just
#: the current one, use all instead of :italic`active`.


#: You can tell kitty to send arbitrary (UTF-8) encoded text to the
#: client program when pressing specified shortcut keys. For example::

#:     map ctrl+alt+a send_text all Special text

#: This will send "Special text" when you press the ctrl+alt+a key
#: combination.  The text to be sent is a python string literal so you
#: can use escapes like \x1b to send control codes or \u21fb to send
#: unicode characters (or you can just input the unicode characters
#: directly as UTF-8 text). The first argument to send_text is the
#: keyboard modes in which to activate the shortcut. The possible
#: values are normal or application or kitty or a comma separated
#: combination of them.  The special keyword all means all modes. The
#: modes normal and application refer to the DECCKM cursor key mode
#: for terminals, and kitty refers to the special kitty extended
#: keyboard protocol.

#: Another example, that outputs a word and then moves the cursor to
#: the start of the line (same as pressing the Home key)::

#:     map ctrl+alt+a send_text normal Word\x1b[H
#:     map ctrl+alt+a send_text application Word\x1bOH
